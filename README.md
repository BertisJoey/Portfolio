# Joey Wiesner Portfolio
Portfolio showcase for my work

## Reason for Portfolio
I found it necessary to create a portfolio so that I could easily link potential employers to my work. Anyone interested in viewing my capabilities and skill should be able to come to this site and see my previous work and get ahold of me if needed.

## Sections of Portolio
I created a section for people to read about me and my intent with my work, a section that contained actual links to my work, and a section to contact me with any questions or follow up.

## Code Sources
